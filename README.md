# BI-on-mongo-with-spark

This is just a small use case of flattening nestes MongoDB JSON data using pySpark.
The same examples could also be used for CosmosDB api for MongoDB.

I am using the data from sample-analytics database from MongoDB.

In the sample_analytics folder, sample documents are shown for the three collections in the database.

The notebooks flatten the data, calculates statstits and vizualize them.
